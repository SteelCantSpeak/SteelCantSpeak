## Character Defects
No Person is complete without some flaws. Mine include the Following:

**Language Comprehension:**
I struggle with understanding long conversation (Essentially my Mind drifts, but instead of daydream, I lose the ability to know what the other person is saying). I Compensate for it by often referring to Subtitles and Transcripts in Video, as well as taking notes/recording Face-to-Face Encounters! 

In addition, My own personal communication can take a hit, and I can say nonsensical words. To combat this, I prefer to use written text. I also have a software running on my Computer that allows me to quickly convert Text to speech for video calls. -->
